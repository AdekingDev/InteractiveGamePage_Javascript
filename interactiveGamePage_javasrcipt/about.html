        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p1>Welcome to the Noughts and Crosses game site. Here you can learn about our history, our team, and our mission.</p1>
        <p>"Noughts and Crosses," also known as "Tic-Tac-Toe," is a simple, two-player game that is widely known and played. Here's a brief overview:
            The main aim is to get three of your marks (either a nought or a cross) in a row, column, or diagonal on a 3x3 grid.

            Players take turns placing their mark (nought or cross) in an empty square.
            The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
            If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.

            Players often start by placing their mark in the center or in a corner.
            Blocking the opponent's potential lines becomes crucial.
            The game ends when there's a line of three or a full grid.

            The game can be played on larger grids for a more complex challenge.
            Some versions add rules like a limited number of moves.
            It's often used as an introductory exercise in strategic thinking and problem-solving for children.

            As a simple and universal game, it's recognized and played globally, often used as a metaphor in various cultural contexts.
